Analysis

About 32% of our customers are in the Western Region
The second largest percentage of our customers are based in the central region
We have the lowest number of buyers from the South
We also have 28.5% of our customers in the Eastern region

Analysis
 
Central Region had 21.8% of sales, but 13.9% of profits

Eastern Region had 29.5% of sales, and 32.0% of profits

Southern Region had 17.1% of sales, and 16.3% of profits

Western Region had 31.6% of sales and 37.9% of profits

We do observe that the more the sales, the more profit the business made this makes sense, we expect to make more profit where we sell more
Southern Region saw the least sales; hence the least profit- this is the region that the business should improve in: do more marketing perharps.

Analysis
 
Most shoppers prefer Standard Class Shipping, followed by Second class.

So most shoppers were not in a rush to get their orders delivered same day, hence only 5.6% sales of Same Day Delivery mode.

We do observe that the more the sales, the more profit the business made, conforming to our original hypothesis

This makes sense, we expect to make more profit where we sell more
